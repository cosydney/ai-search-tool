I live my purpose through helping people, learning, and contributing to difference-making.  

Holding successive Operations roles, I am a leader who likes to fix and optimize while balancing the needs of employees through authentic and empowering relationship-building.   Most recently I developed a voice of the customer program which included:  improving customer journeys, providing service excellence, and introducing digital optimization to reduce customer effort and improve KPI performance.   CX data and insights was a key ingredient to leading the change for customers.

I am proud of my ability and accomplishments surrounding current state assessments, understanding of gaps and more importantly, discovering opportunities for success.  I dig deep as needed to understand the ‘day in the life’ and gain the trust of the team.  Through understanding, I pivot teams to align to new approaches and goals that align with company objectives, that are measurable and well-defined.  I champion my cause whether it be value in program effectiveness or team performance.  Through this approach, I have improved service levels and customer metrics while increasing engagement scores.  I am a resilient leader in unsettling times and use effective communication to earn and maintain the trust of the team.  You can count on me for establishing credibility early-on.

I'm continually looking for new ways to expand my love of leadership, client/customer satisfaction, operations, transformation, and data insights.

Many physicians Face overwhelming administrative burdens, high-pressure work environments, & unhealthy coping mechanisms like comfort eating, drinking, or smoking. You might know the risks but feel powerless to make a change.  

I’m here to help. As a physician coach and employee wellness coach, I specialize in guiding healthcare professionals and organizations toward lasting health, resilience, and fulfillment. Using proven techniques, I empower physicians to break free from stress and burnout, rebuild their energy, and regain control of their lives—all without sacrificing their mental and physical health.  

My Story  
A few years ago, as a primary care physician with almost a decade of experience, I faced similar struggles. The stress of long hours and unhealthy habits led me to develop lifestyle diseases. By embracing positive lifestyle changes, I transformed my health, and journey inspired me to share my expertise to help doctors.
Today, as a trained health and wellness coach, I leverage my clinical expertise to help physicians and healthcare employees achieve sustainable health behavior changes. My approach is compassionate, evidence-based, and tailored to meet your unique needs.  

What I Do  

1)For Physicians 
-1:1 Personalized Coaching: to help you build resilience, work-life balance, and achieve fulfillment without burnout.  

2)For Organizations  
- I design and deliver workplace wellness programs to support healthcare staff in reducing stress, improving overall well-being, and enhancing productivity.  

Expertise:
Health Behavior Change Coaching
Motivational Interviewing
Neurolinguistic Programming
Health Goal Setting and Tracking
Workplace Wellness Program Design

Why It Works  
- Personal Experience: I’ve been where you are and know the path to lasting change.    
-Evidence-Based: My coaching is rooted in research for:  
a)Developing stress resilience
b)Improving work-life balance
c)Implementing healthy coping mechanisms
 
My work has been featured in respected publications like the Harvard Blog, British Medical Journal,etc.

From co-locating machines to managing many Virtual Private Servers (web hosting, email hosting (the largest client with a custom webmail interface and 200+ accounts), private git repository hosting, etc...) to network security to Bitcoin & digital asset mining, trading and investing to writing custom end-to-end b2b and b2c business solutions, the Internet has proven to be the perfect place for this endlessly-curious tech-and-business-minded human to carve out a living and find his own path.

In the more recent past, from 2009-2021 I was the CTO w/OGOP. There, responsibilities included all systems, from the digital strategy to the design and development of the public facing website, the design and development of the administrative interface for franchise owners, and the design and development of the on-site (but offline, with full sync support) Point-of-Sale systems used during each event.

Then, I spent some time in the fast-paced agency world as the Head of a Solutions Design department, a chief architect, a product manager, an engineering manager, a tech lead, a project manager, a scrum master, a devops engineer, a secops engineer and a web developer doing mostly api and backend development in Python & PHP.

Now, I’m focused on a single, purpose-filled mission - helping other Canadian humans live better, healthier lives - with the non-profit company Greenshield. I’m so incredibly grateful for the talent that surrounds me each day, I can’t wait to get up and get to work and to serve them however I can.",,Non-profit Organizations,"Windsor, Ontario, Canada","Lakeshore, Ontario, Canada",1 year 10 months in role,1 year 10 months in company,,,,,,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQFewvFbFExQdw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1682957430742?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=kDlSatJs0MJX8V8RwgbrtRkOqGtOdaczwPNsS-tRAlQ,0,Jadel McGuire,ACwAACtKgi4BdOhSjEOAz8FlFIWGr4l3DUXGWZ4,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAACtKgi4BdOhSjEOAz8FlFIWGr4l3DUXGWZ4/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(recentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4050936922%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2CspellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A36107%2Ctext%3AGreenShield%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522%2520OR%2520growth%2520OR%2520Ecomm%2520OR%2520Web)&sessionId=uBFDCCT2Rxi1HD5ChAEHGw%3D%3D,2025-01-09T11:00:55.490Z,https://linkedin.com/in/jadel-mcguire

And, on top of all that, Amy is an incredibly fun person to work with. Every product and project I've worked on since would have been better off if Amy had been on the team."" -Aaron Jarecki, CTO, Groupdesk.io

I'm a self-motivated Frontend Software Engineer with 7 years of experience in developing innovative web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React. Throughout my career, I have consistently driven efficiency and contributed to business growth by delivering scalable and user-centric solutions. I have a strong track record of collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams and possess excellent communication skills.

In my most recent role at Shopify, I collaborated with engineers and scientists to build highly scalable systems that facilitated data-driven decision-making and insights. I successfully helped increased the number of experiments run by 80%, with a 300% increase in teams using the testing tool. Additionally, I reduced bug tickets by 30% by taking the initiative and implementing a UI library called Storybook resulting in improved communication and customization between developers, designers, and product managers.

During my tenure at Deloitte Digital, I led a team of developers in redesigning a Shopify Health Marketplace, achieving improved Google performance scores by 50%. I actively engaged with clients to gather requirements, define user architecture, and ensure alignment between technical solutions and objectives. I also mentored junior developers and contributed to the implementation of continuous integration practices, resulting in decreased bugs and increased release speed.

In my earlier experience at Bounteous, I developed and maintained web and mobile experiences for Shopify and Magento websites, consistently delivering highly optimized and visually appealing interfaces. I have a strong educational background, including a Front-End Web Development Bootcamp and a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology.

Outside of work, I am passionate about giving back to the community. As a mentor with Canada Learning Code, I have taught beginners the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also volunteered at the Toronto International Film Festival, providing customer service and answering questions.

I am excited to bring my skills and expertise to contribute to a team that aligns with my values and experience.

Telemedicine: Collaborating closely with executives, developers, and designers, I guided the team to create a user-centered experience that sets us apart in the competitive insurance landscape. I partnered with sales and account management teams to conduct demos and pitch our telemedicine product to prospective clients, supporting sales conversion.

🏢 Currently, I work as a Jr. IT Project Manager at GreenShield.

Throughout my career, I have lead national, multi-million dollar web development projects for some of Canada's largest and most influential corporations. I have implemented agile methodologies (focusing on minimization of lead-time), to streamline project management on the teams I've consulted, which has resulted in an overall improvement in cross-functional team performance. I am an expert in the design &  documentation of digital user journeys, with a focus on product user experience. 

My achievements span from the Product Management of a National & heavily trafficked online application, leading a multi-million dollar Insurance & health-services web-development project, and coordinating the training of thousands of pharmacies across Canada.

But instead, I’ll tell you this: I am a marathon runner.

A marathon is a 26.2 mile run following a pretty tough 16 week training schedule.  I came across an article awhile ago that talked about the traits of a marathon runner:

1.	Focused
2.	Inspiring
3.	Resilient
4.	Motivated
5.	Social
6.	Prepared
7.	Brave

Yes this is who I am!  In and out of the office, these powerful words really do describe who I am.   And this is why in past and present roles, I am relishing a fabulous gratifying career.  

I have led a team of front-line staff and mentored a team of supervisors. I have successfully managed complex projects, been a champion for change, implemented cost saving enhancements, increased employee engagement, and built inclusive transparent relationships with the same passion and enthusiasm as preparing for the marathon.

I am a true believer in life-long learning and growth which is why I've covered the 26.2 mile run 14 times.   I'll continue to push myself in all aspects of my life, running included.  At the very core, my greatest satisfaction comes from a job well done.

Let's connect.  I'd love to hear how your passion shows up in your work.","- Utilize LEAN principles to identify opportunities for efficiencies and make recommendations for process improvement in the Call Center, driving both employee engagement and customer satisfaction

Currently, I am majoring in English Literature and Rhetoric with a minor in Legal Studies. I chose this field of study because I enjoy looking at things both holistically and with a microscope; something the English major demands. It creates an environment in which I look at my surroundings contextually. This is conjoined with my eagerness to learn and my curiosity for the things that concern humanity. This is a stream that is extensively spoken about and satiated with my legal studies minor. This duo improves my communication skills, and hones in my ability to look at works (whether that be written/oral) with great attention to detail. I am further able to work on my creative interests in writing, reading, event planning, graphic design, and video editing with my volunteer positions and co-op. 

Working with the University of Waterloo’s English department as a Video Editor and Web Designer was able to fully foster and grow these skills in a working environment outside of academia. I was able to apply these skills while also simultaneously gaining new ones such as editing videos and formally written syllabi as well as designing graphics for the University’s annual English awards ceremony. These skills coincide with my field of study allowing me to add a personal touch that causes readers and viewers to empathize with my work. 

I was able to explore my ability to communicate with other students and try a hand at teaching as a Tutoring and Learning Assistant at George Brown College. I was required to host tutorials and tutoring sessions for ESL students, I gained experience in teaching and leadership and honed in graphic design skills from my previous co-op to create presentations for my weekly lessons. I aimed to increase engagement and as a result academic success from the students; I achieved this by getting to know them on a personal level and creating an environment where they felt free to express their struggles and we tackled them in an open environment. 

Through all these creative opportunities to grow my skills and my desire to create a comfortable and open space, I was able to successfully meet and exceed the margins of the various fields I was in.",,Non-profit Organizations,"Windsor, Ontario, Canada","Greater Toronto Area, Canada", 5 months in role, 9 months in company,University of Waterloo,https://www.linkedin.com/company/166688,Video Editor and Web Designer ,01/2022-04/2022,3 months,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQF7Z4D2QXltdQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1694401675873?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=rfndP95XudF53NwATzzODuO6_HQUPei1JKKD98Lkotc,0,Tehreem Jadoon,ACwAAECd3ikBAzRDXsNcOBp2LTyT7G9d96PVWU0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAECd3ikBAzRDXsNcOBp2LTyT7G9d96PVWU0/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(recentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4050936922%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2CspellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A36107%2Ctext%3AGreenShield%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522%2520OR%2520growth%2520OR%2520Ecomm%2520OR%2520Web)&sessionId=uBFDCCT2Rxi1HD5ChAEHGw%3D%3D,2025-01-09T11:03:54.783Z,https://linkedin.com/in/tehreem-jadoon-7a1085263

There are two central experiences that keep me dedicated and enthusiastic about software development.

The first is the utilization of my ability to think logically and problem solve. I enjoy analyzing a problem, conceiving a potential solution, and putting the solution into action. Although this may take much time and re-thinking, it is always very satisfying for me to accomplish my goal and witness a solution in action.

Second, I very much enjoy working within an equally passionate team. It is always helpful to communicate within a group and refine ideas and learn from one another. I find it very satisfying when I am able to explain a concept to a team member and help that person with their understanding. Likewise, if I am confused by a concept, I enjoy feeling confident that I can voice my confusion and receive help and grow my understanding.

Software development provides me the experience of building solutions to real-life problems and the culture of teaching and learning mutually among a diverse team. This will keep me enthusiastic and dedicated to software development for many years to come. ","- Cypress.io - Web-based applications

My name is Melanie and I love to help people. 

I can remember my third grade teacher asking a classroom full of impressionable, wonder filled, 8-year-old minds what we wanted to be when we grew up? Some of my classmates wanted to be dancers, fire fighters, some astronauts and doctors – and I wanted to help people. I didn't know how and if I'm being frank... the 'how' wasn't all that concerning to me either. All that mattered to me was to spend my life making those around me smile and by George was I going to make that happen. 

Many years, countless community support initiatives and life lessons later I find myself in an industry that takes pride in helping others, offering peace of mind when times get tough – Insurance. I began building the foundation of my career in Customer Service facing roles that put my desire to offer kindness and care to the test. In 2020, I stepped into a Sales specific role to focus my skills on a more niche audience, offering my support and product expertise to Health and Dental insurance advisors.

I am passionate about taking the foundational values I’ve had, ever since I was a third grade dreamer wherever I find myself. Join me on my journey of spreading kindness wherever possible.","- Develop and maintain distribution partner relationships, supporting sales growth of MGA distribution partners

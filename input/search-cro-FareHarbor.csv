My experience spans across building scalable systems in cloud-native and DevOps environments, where my goal is to create software that meets user needs and delights them ✨.

💼 At FareHarbor, I led a major platform redesign, leveraging cloud-native principles and DevOps methodologies, reducing bugs by 30% and improving user satisfaction by 25%. At IKEA, I co-founded the data platform team, where we launched products that boosted revenue by 20% and customer satisfaction by 15%. However, my true passion lies in data storage—optimizing, managing, and ensuring its reliability is where I thrive 📊.

🔑 My time at Slack showcased my love for data systems, where I improved database uptime by 15%, implemented advanced MySQL and Vitess techniques, and built self-service tools that accelerated project delivery by 20%. I’m constantly pushing the boundaries of data stores like Kafka, Redis, and Vitess, ensuring that data flows efficiently, reliably, and securely 💾.

🌐 With expertise in AWS, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and Terraform, I drive technical strategies that optimize performance, reduce costs, and ensure seamless data storage management. Every challenge in the data landscape excites me, and I’m always eager to dive deep into new architectures and frameworks 🔍.

📚 I’m committed to continuous learning—whether it’s mastering new languages like Go and Python, or exploring cutting-edge data storage frameworks to stay ahead of the curve.

🎸 Outside of coding, I find inspiration in rock and metal music. Strumming my guitar fuels my creativity and keeps me energized for my next big technical adventure ⚡.

Let’s connect and explore how I can help you build resilient and scalable data-driven systems! 🚀","• Transformed Engineering Domain Architecture, implementing cloud-native principles, clear areas of ownership, enhanced support, and streamlined DevOps processes.

Experienced Vue.js and AngularJs, along with HTML and CSS, I bring extensive experience to transform creative ideas into functional, visually compelling digital solutions. This expertise ensures a seamless and engaging user experience, crafting dynamic solutions that elevate brands and captivate audiences.""

Beyond coding, I contribute to diverse Scrum teams by turning creative ideas into digital realities. My career, spanning product-based and consultancy landscapes, has enhanced my skills in innovation, problem-solving, and collaboration across various industries.

While I excel in front-end development, I seamlessly navigate backend languages, databases, and CI/CD pipelines, providing a holistic approach to digital solutions.

If you want to discuss further, feel free to send me a message. Let's explore turning your vision into a captivating digital reality.","As a front-end developer at FareHarbor, I was brought on board to spearhead the enhancement and modernization of the front-end stack on-the-fly.

Strategic Modernization:
Initiated a transformative plan to upgrade the company's front-end infrastructure. This involved migrating from a deprecated monolith AngularJs application to a cutting-edge set of business-logic-agnostic Vue.js components and reusable, framework-agnostic Javascript services.

Enhanced User Experience:
Implemented an innovative application preloading feature, significantly boosting user perception performance. This enhancement contributed to a smoother and more responsive user interface, positively impacting overall user satisfaction.

Optimized Booking Conversions:
Successfully increased booking conversions by introducing partial payment features, including the implementation of deposits and post-booking payment options. This strategic move not only enhanced user convenience but also positively impacted the company's bottom line.

In this dynamic role, my focus on strategic modernization and user-centric enhancements played a crucial role in elevating FareHarbor's technological landscape and ensuring a seamless experience for both internal teams and end-users.",Travel Arrangements,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands",Amsterdam Area,4 years 9 months in role,4 years 9 months in company,,,,,,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEfT94d-wP2IQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1687593078861?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=kEMTMI5-MmbUFUR_Oh-d_88Hp51wQb0BFR1uFbeLVH8,0,Adal Bueno,ACwAAAFl8gsBfG4kBtXSWz6OXRqcpqYNhAnvEk4,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAFl8gsBfG4kBtXSWz6OXRqcpqYNhAnvEk4/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4046810362%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A2957445%2Ctext%3AFareHarbor%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522)&sessionId=nVRrxiHsThmm6EYzyVLGlg%3D%3D,2025-01-08T10:27:47.387Z,https://linkedin.com/in/adalbueno

1. Be curious - My managers & mentors have always pointed out my love of learning & growth. I find the prospect that there’s infinite knowledge out there very exciting & an encouraging reminder that there’s always a way to be better.
2. Find fulfilment - I’m at my best when devoting my time to what I’m passionate about or find meaningful. Dedicating myself to something I believe in & creating impact fulfils me & inspires me to continue driving forward even through challenging times.
3. Start with the Problem - I enjoy facing complex problems & challenges. Whether it be a yoga student struggling with a pose or a drop in the funnel, I’m always excited by the problem-solving process. It’s fascinating how truly understanding a problem is a great way to gauge my own skill/understanding level in a field, how it’s the key to unlocking the right solution & can also be very fun.

With ~8 yrs of PM, Sales, Marketing & Finance experience, including 4+ yrs of Product Mgmt, I’ve truly enjoyed all the challenges I’ve met at each step of my career. In my current role as the Squad Lead for Lending, I spearhead the Lending product strategy, vision, commercial strategy, OKRs and either work closely with or manage two other PMs & a dedicated tech squad to achieve continuous success in our Lending & Credit vertical. Previously I've managed Remittances, Insurance & Operations (Staff) squads. Although I’m Scrum-certified, I’ve used various Agile ways-of-working.

Some of my key achievements in my PM career include:
- The launch & growth of International & Local Bank Transfers across APAC from both Malaysia & Singapore
- The launch & growth of Personal Loans, the first fully digital loan product in Malaysia
- Conducted TV broadcasted product showcases to key figures such as the ex-Prime Minister and the ex-Minister of Local Government Development

My time at Red Bull gave me the on-the-ground skills to understand customer behaviour. Coupled with my experience at Hays of managing & finalising deals with C-suite & Exec levels in Global Banks & FIs, I’ve developed a good understanding of commercials, business needs & how to work with a variety of stakeholders.

Overall, I love working in a highly-collaborative, measurable, clear & transparent work environment with strong leadership. Outside of work, I’m also a certified yoga teacher, and my hobbies include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Freediving, Poetry, Hiking, Gardening & Backpacking. My interests also include environmental sustainability & social welfare.",,Travel Arrangements,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands","Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands",1 year 1 month in role,1 year 1 month in company,,,,,,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5603AQGe_Twobt17vQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1650440833803?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=0jJ-FDbzZUAeHazQuYVfsDAshSJBE8hrhoZmRffg6eE,1,Kamalia Mohd,ACwAAANvlt0BLEeKywkdwj0wksSQSMVGmUgNBIk,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAANvlt0BLEeKywkdwj0wksSQSMVGmUgNBIk/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4046810362%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A2957445%2Ctext%3AFareHarbor%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522)&sessionId=nVRrxiHsThmm6EYzyVLGlg%3D%3D,2025-01-08T10:27:47.387Z,https://linkedin.com/in/kamaliam

Over the last 20+ years I have been fortunate to work for successful small, medium and large companies.  These businesses are all unique but there are more commonalities than differences to what constitutes excellent management and leadership in each environment.

Small Business experience helps teach the value of doing to acquire a deep knowledge of operational excellence (hiring, training, analytics, auditing, front line management etc.). It is hard to really understand the importance of these areas unless you have been in the trenches and were accountable for the outcomes.

Large business experience is a great sandlot for teaching why collaboration and relationships are so essential to success. To strategically apply that hard-fought knowledge, you must work across business units and departments to effectively implement ideas and solutions.

As a senior manager / leader I am interested in consistently learning while applying the best practices I learned along the way.

I possess a deep understanding of web development, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, cloud computing, microservices architecture, database technologies, and networking.

Engineering is my passion. I have dedicated years to building scalable, maintainable, and flexible software systems, gaining invaluable knowledge from the challenges I’ve faced and the talented colleagues I’ve collaborated with.

I am driven by the desire to work for, or eventually create, companies that aim to make a positive impact on people’s lives, even if it’s a small change. This mission-oriented approach makes me selective about the organizations I choose to work with. I have a solid grasp of business operations and always prioritize user experience.

Key technologies and tools I’ve worked with include:
Python, Django, JavaScript, Vue.js, Flask, Cypress, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, RESTful API, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, C/C++, GoogleTest, Valgrind, Java, Android Programming, Linux, Linux Kernel, Real-time OSs, InfluxDB, Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, and Git.","At FareHarbor, I am part of a dedicated team responsible for the affiliate-related aspects of our software product, which is a crucial component of our offering. Our technology stack includes PostgreSQL, Python/Django for the backend, and Vue.js for the frontend. My role encompasses the entire development lifecycle, from requirement analysis and architectural decision-making to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Our team embraces an agile mindset, encouraging experimentation and shorter development cycles. This approach allows us to gather user feedback early and often, which has proven invaluable in refining our product.

I am a strong advocate of test-driven development (TDD) and strive to incorporate unit tests, component tests, and end-to-end tests for the changes I implement. I maintain high standards for code documentation, simplicity, readability, and managing technical debt.

Beyond regular software development tasks, I am also involved in the interview process, mentorship, and occasionally take on project leadership responsibilities.",Travel Arrangements,"Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands","Amstelveen, North Holland, Netherlands",2 years 9 months in role,2 years 9 months in company,,,,,,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEvT2qC-8d85A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1701097462083?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=TzgMJY-kQoq9Fmo5VfWFAVN9G-lZPpSF3DBOQZc3V_E,0,Aliakbar Abbasi,ACwAAAefuKAB2u6V_SXchueBy2uQ-8jXN9y1nWw,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAefuKAB2u6V_SXchueBy2uQ-8jXN9y1nWw/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4046810362%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A2957445%2Ctext%3AFareHarbor%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522)&sessionId=nVRrxiHsThmm6EYzyVLGlg%3D%3D,2025-01-08T10:28:10.472Z,https://linkedin.com/in/abbasiali

I'm a Cloud Security Engineer with over 7 years in tech, deeply passionate about making our digital spaces safer. My journey has taken me from a broad interest in technology to specializing in security, with a focus on cloud environments over the last 2 years. I hold a Master’s in Cybersecurity, I am OSCP certified, and have developed a keen understanding of multiple systems / security related technologies.

In my current role, I wear many hats - from shaping security policies and handling incidents to threat modelling and collaborating across our organization. It's a role that keeps me on my toes and always learning. For example in the past year I've been focusing my efforts towards security audits, helping to assess our security posture and at the same time implement or modify existing controls.

What really excites me is the challenge of the unknown. There's hardly anything I believe I can't learn - a philosophy that’s pushed me to continually grow both professionally and personally.

If you're into making technology safer, smarter, and more intuitive, let's connect. I'm always up for sharing ideas and learning from others in this endlessly fascinating field.


Some of the courses I've completed on Linux Academy:
CompTIA CySA+ Certification
Docker Quick Start
CompTIA Security+ Certification Prep
CompTIA Pentest+ Certification

No, I am not talking about the cute little animals we all know and love. I am talking about the evil search engine algorithms Google releases every few months. Not only do I enjoy analyzing and helping sites recover from these annoying penalties, I am an experienced SEO professional with a passion for everything related to search engine optimization.

I have really enjoyed honing my skills in developing effective SEO campaigns based on thorough research and analysis. I never really had a true mentor/expert to help guide and develop my career which gave me a little chip on my shoulder. I learned SEO by experimenting, analyzing sites and competitors, reading industry blogs, testing and of course more testing. When it comes to SEO, I employ a multi-pronged approach that involves methods such as keyword research and analysis, the creation of unique and relevant content, onsite optimization, link building, competitor analysis and social media. Whatever the methods, I accompany them with thorough analysis and data to continually monitor and optimize. 

I consider the knowledge I obtained at my previous employer invaluable. I became an SEO and content marketing expert by being thrown in with the wolves. The main takeaway I learned is that when you build the right team and they become a family anything is possible. Yes, you will have some failures along the way, but sometimes failing could be the best thing for you. You pick yourself up and learn from it.

I am compelled to pursue a career that combines the need for data, with the humanistic aspects of
business, which initially gravitated me toward digital marketing. After sifting through the multidimensional world, I have upskilled and reorientated as a Web Designer with a deep understanding of SEO and content writing.

Attending 5 schools, living in several cities, experiencing two different career fields, and moving to a
country on another continent has taught me one thing – change is daunting, but it has prepared me to
face and adapt to just about any environment.

Doing my Bachelor’s in civil engineering was a thoroughly insightful education for me, but I realized that I
did not want to pursue work that only employed “concrete” theories and principles. I did not want to
“cement” my career (puns intended) in a field that would not let me try new, creative avenues.

However, gaining strong analytical skills in this journey, and combining them with my relentless
curiosity to learn what makes us humans tick makes me a perfect candidate for the dynamic field of
content creation.

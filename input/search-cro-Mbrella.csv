Currently taking the Mbrella product (SaaS) from zero to one to redefine corporate mobility. Ex-banking. Failed an app startup but learned a ton.

üöÄ MY STARTUP CAREER
As a graduate student, I started my entrepreneurial journey by founding Moovle, an app startup to connect football players in cities and help them find enough players for their games. We won Start Academy for Young Entrepreneurs (Belgium‚Äôs top student startup competition) and launched our product in summer 2018. 

We failed but it taught me an incredible amount about pitching, product development, digital marketing, strategy and team dynamics. During those 2 years, I felt like doing 3 MBAs.

üëî MY CONSULTING CAREER
While still bootstrapping Moovle on the side, I started working as a consultant for EY (Ernst & Young) in the financial industry. 

First, I worked for 1 year as a sales manager for a bank‚Äôs digital banking platform. I had 800 corporate clients in my portfolio and managed to turn our team‚Äôs digital sales and activation rates from a 15th (out of 16) position to a 1st place, beating the targets by far.

Next, I worked as a business analyst where I managed the core features (+5 million yearly visits) of a digital banking platform at a leading Belgian bank (yes, we worked agile).

My experience in banking improved my product management skills and taught me how big corporations function. It also taught me a lot of do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts üòâ

‚òÇÔ∏è BACK TO THE STARTUP ROOTS
Once you've got bitten by the startup bug, it's hard to resist. Logically, I returned to the startup scene after my years in the corporate world. 

Frustrated and fascinated by the mobility crisis we're going through, I wanted to help ban this issue from our world. The key to attacking this problem is by attacking the root of it: corporate mobility. 

At Mbrella, we believe that mobility should empower people and lead to a happier, freer and sustainable society. Focusing on user-friendly technology and deep integrations with the mobility ecosystem is the best way to do that. Our HR platform allows companies to create a flexible mobility plan their employees need.

So far, it's one hell of a ride!

Hit me up if you need startup advice or want to chat about product strategy and the future of mobility.

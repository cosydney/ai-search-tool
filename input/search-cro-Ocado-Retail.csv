I believe that there is huge value in making the user experience such that the user can achieve their visit goals with ease and expedience and that in achieving this we can delight our users. This is important as the result can be a loyal relationship with our users and customers opening them up to further engagement and conversion opportunities.
 
Multivariate and A/B testing are essential components in any great optimisation strategy, when used correctly they can offer a level confidence unmatched through other methods in the determination of the incremental benefit potentially gained through said change. I have experience creating benefit cases for the development and implementation of customer experience and personalisation improvements, and have proven experience in driving these changes to ultimately improve conversion rates, lower cart abandonment and drive incremental benefit to site revenue. 

Online retail is ever changing; it is essential that your development and optimisation strategies aim to continually improve the user experience. One highly effective way of achieving this is through offering engaging and relevant content though personalisation. 

Knowing your customer well, making the best use of the data available to you, and attempting pre-empt their wants, preferences and needs to offer a tailored experience is of key importance to any conversion optimisation strategy.

A strategy that focuses on differentiating your offering and leveraging your USP's is essential to develop a website and brand offering that excites and delights your customers with every visit and purchase. 

Every aspect of the user experience from how the user hears about your brand, landing on your website, finding what they want and purchasing, right through to how that product is presented and packaged on arrival is vitally important. A good optimisation strategy should be set up and equipped in such a way that potential friction points that could occur at any one of these stages may easily be identified and solutions tested and implemented to optimise the flow as soon as possible – this is what I believe to be the key to achieving great conversion and business optimisation.

I’m a full stack developer working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node, SQL and MongoDB. My current interests are: AWS, nginx, CI/CD, and testing with Jest and Vitest. 

When I was a kid, my computer ran Windows 98, and it was the coolest thing ever😎. This passion for computers has been reignited last year when I enrolled in a software engineering boot camp.  
After the course, I took on the role of a TA for two cohorts. This experience allowed me to mentor and teach people how to code.

I’m driven by that “wow, you built that?” and the belief that I can make a real impact with software.
Oh, I also blog about code and I enjoy writing technical tutorials!📖

My core skills include design leadership, user research, and iterative design, all guided by a commitment to understanding and addressing user needs through data-driven insights and usability testing.

I hold a BA (Hons) in Design for Industry from Northumbria University, where I built a strong foundation in UX principles and design thinking. One of my standout achievements was redesigning the National Rail train ticket, which earned me first place in the prestigious Royal Society of Arts competition. Since then, I’ve continued to refine my skills through hands-on experience and a commitment to ongoing learning, consistently utilising industry best practices and customer insights to drive impactful design.

Throughout my career, I've led and contributed to numerous high-impact projects in Transportation, Edutech, Retail and E-commerce. At Ocado Retail, I spearheaded the redesign of the logged-out homepage, achieving a 6.1% increase in user registrations and a 6.3% boost in slots booked. Additionally, I led the design of a loyalty wallet page that resulted in a 3% increase in voucher use. My work has been recognised with awards, including a third place at the 2023 ContentSquare Awards for Best Single Page Optimisation, and the Best Business Class Lounge Design at the Skytrax World Airline Awards in 2019.

To enhance my skills beyond work, I have dedicated time to learning no-code development tools such as Webflow and Framer. I have also designed websites and branding for small businesses, applying design leadership to highlight the importance of responsive design, web accessibility, search engine optimisation, and effective UX copywriting.

It’s a privilege to lead this amazing business. Every day, I get to work with a brilliant team to deliver wonderful food, drink and more to households up and down the UK. 

I’ve held various positions at Ocado since 2012 which have given me experience in and understanding of almost every corner of the business - from the world-class technology powering Ocado.com, to opening doors to new and exciting brands with a listing on Ocado, to the areas we can continue to develop to enhance the shopping experience. 

I care deeply about delivering amazing experiences for our customers. There’s no other supermarket that offers the unbeatable range of products that Ocado does, at reassuringly good value, all conveniently delivered with the best levels of service. 

I’m a huge foodie and at the weekend, you’ll find me checking out the latest recipes to find inspiration for what I’m going to cook next for family and friends. I love finding new products in my Ocado shops and getting creative with whatever’s in season.

Sounds simple but there are no shortcuts to creating engaged and motivated teams. Throughout my career, I have observed leaders overlooking the seemingly unimportant elements of people management. They underestimate the importance of connecting with their colleagues on a human level; without this connection, they’re left wondering why teams aren’t motivated to deliver the expected performance. 

My approach is pragmatic. I focus on developing and engaging people while implementing clear policies that create or reinforce team culture. I have a successful history of transforming underperforming teams in fast-paced operations with a record of inspiring culture change and developing teams which exceed business expectations.

I am delighted to have secured a position as a Customer Hub Advisor at Ocado Retail in Sunderland to continue my Ocado adventure. After a year in the role I have been promoted to Performance Coach and I am responsible for maintaining the performance of my team and helping out other teams in the Customer Hub when needed. I am really enjoying my new role and the variety it gives me.

In 2018 I decided on a change of pace and a re-evaluation of my work/life balance.  I was delighted to have been offered the opportunity by Ocado at their Dordon CFC just 2 miles from home.  I am now over 6 years into my Ocado adventure and I am loving every minute of it.  Initially as a CSTM at the sharp end delivering to customers and then in 2020 as a Team Manager, I loved the role and the team.  I tried to make a positive difference every day and prided myself on doing a good thorough job.  My role was split between managing the shift and managing the people.

The people management side was very diverse and covered areas like welfare informal 1-2-1's and helping with shift and emergency holiday requests that seem minor in comparison to other matters but mean a lot to the individuals concerned.  To the opposite end of the spectrum with much more in depth matters like disciplinary meetings and long term absence meetings where continued employment may be at stake.  I have been involved in very complex cases where protected characteristics are are involved and have had to deal with very difficult conversations over death in service benefits with terminally ill employees.  I have always done my best to be fair and consistent at all times based on policy, procedures, legislation and Ocado values.  I do my best to keep up to date with current legislation through well known web bases newsletters and sites.
The last few years managing people has made me realise that's where my strength lies, in people; with my passion to help, coach & mentor.  With my management experience I was regularly called on by trainee managers for my advice and coaching. I am a Mental Health First Aider and a Medical First Aider and find that these roles help me in 1-2-1 situations.

The shift management was a true team effort every shift and we prided ourselves on making it happen. Effective, decisive and timely communication is paramount.  We had set tasks that are time critical during each shift; these can be reports or actions that had to be completed in tight time windows.",I am currently seconded for 6 months in the role of Performance Coach at the Ocado Retail Customer Hub in Sunderland.

I then spent 2 years working as a commercial Project Manager dealing with a range of predominantly fresh suppliers, managing end to end supply chain projects.

Following that I moved into an online retail operations team, leading projects and strategy development within Tesco's online grocery operation. As well as improving the customer proposition of Tesco.com, this work delivered £3M in cost savings through operational efficiencies.

I then did 5 years in leading a team providing suppliers with detailed insights into customer behavior, sales and web analytics for Ocado. In that time I built the team up from 2 to 12 analysts, signing the largest suppliers up to the Ocado supplier insights proposition. I was responsible for creating and delivering the pitch for new suppliers, managing the team’s personal development, taking the lead in team training and developing and implementing best practice.

As part of that role I took the opportunity to build tools to commercialise the analysis. This work has delivered over £9M in direct incremental profit to the business, with additional benefits coming from an improved customer proposition and more effective sales strategies. As a result of the successful implementation of this, my current role involves further development of this platform, looking driving additional value for the business through both direct revenue creation and making better analytics available internally.",,Retail,"Hatfield, England, United Kingdom","Hatfield, England, United Kingdom",5 years 1 month in role,5 years 1 month in company,,,,,,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQG709tBAymFAw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1519419697071?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=2fqWJ5mxmgn3wN-i_KkJ_Ue6AGqN53InVwPELpwSwe4,1,David Webb,ACwAABCtNs0BS6HKeUY6iPU2jUl2U5DUs7mdtbw,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABCtNs0BS6HKeUY6iPU2jUl2U5DUs7mdtbw/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(recentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4046579090%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2CspellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A21668932%2Ctext%3AOcado%2520Retail%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522%2520OR%2520growth%2520OR%2520Ecomm%2520OR%2520Web)&sessionId=4xwjN013QvqVsnGjQPA%2FOA%3D%3D,2025-01-08T10:07:01.516Z,https://linkedin.com/in/dave-webb-ocado

With a strong foundation in computing and interactive media, I am eager to leverage my knowledge and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the technology industry.

Throughout my academic career, I have demonstrated a commitment to excellence, consistently striving to achieve the best results. My open-minded approach to work allows me to actively seek feedback and rapidly adapt to new challenges, enhancing my fast learning capabilities.

During my three years studying for a BSc in Interactive Media, I greatly enhanced my software development skills by taking on multiple team and solo projects. These projects included app and game development, UX design, working with complex input and output devices such as VR, and creating and editing graphics and UX elements.

Alongside my studies, I have held multiple part-time jobs within the retail sector in various roles. I was able to showcase and build upon several important skills, such as effective timekeeping, teamwork, and customer service. I have also gained significant experience in diverse and dynamic working environments.

I thrive in high-pressure and dynamic environments, where my ability to assess all options and make strategic decisions benefits both my personal growth and team success. As a proactive team player, I am dedicated to contributing to collaborative projects and driving collective goals forward.

I always aspire to make strides in the right direction, both metaphorically and literally. My interests include the ever-expanding field of technology, as well as sports and outdoor activities, especially football, hiking, and running. In 2024, as part of a football team, another committee member and I organized a charity fundraiser for MacMillan, Mind UK, and Dementia UK across the Yorkshire Three Peaks. After the 24-mile hike, we raised £1,400 for the three charities, along with an unforgettable experience and lasting memories.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in software development, where I can continue to grow professionally and make a positive impact post-university.",,Retail,"Hatfield, England, United Kingdom","Potters Bar, England, United Kingdom", 5 months in role, 5 months in company,,,,,,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQFWQg-p9KqAUg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1722278430859?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=TLVQ6gDZGEmZFg0MQblGI5TP9NipFRJJT8HYc709OEM,0,Archie Bett,ACwAADirrboBUSiQkJr9sas0DLTjuGfqqXiXulk,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAADirrboBUSiQkJr9sas0DLTjuGfqqXiXulk/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(recentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4046579090%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2CspellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A21668932%2Ctext%3AOcado%2520Retail%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522%2520OR%2520growth%2520OR%2520Ecomm%2520OR%2520Web)&sessionId=4xwjN013QvqVsnGjQPA%2FOA%3D%3D,2025-01-08T10:07:44.322Z,https://linkedin.com/in/archie-bett-18a4b5226

As a leader, I am responsible for my team of advisor’s performance; ensuring that I am effectively coaching and motivating them towards their targets and hitting their Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s).  I have worked across retentions, loyalty and mobile as well as a period as a role model for new recruits. 

I am passionate in my quest for the delivery of the best customer service. In working towards this I am strong in my ability to make important decisions as well as facilitate them on the back of forming relationships with key stakeholders. I am both excellent and confident in delivering information in an informal setting on a teams call or more formally as part of presentation, ensuring key messages are delivered. 

Although I have proven myself to be a key member of a working team, I am able to work independently often and with success. I can generate my own workload and ensure the work I deliver is of high quality and delivered well within given time constraints.  I am confident in decision making, ensuring that I consider the bigger picture and how I can impact this whilst meeting the business goals.

🚀 I have always been fascinated by technology and its dynamic evolution in today’s world. This fascination propelled me into the realm of self-learning and discovery, focusing mainly on software development and IT operations. My journey began with Python, a relatively simple programming language, and soon expanded to include JavaScript.

📱 Driven by a hunger for knowledge, I developed a mobile application using a JavaScript framework. Although these initial applications lacked real-world solutions, they paved the way for my professional growth. This journey led me to join QA as a tech consultant, a role that has significantly enriched my experience and insight into agile methodology, deployment, testing, and integration.

🌟 In addition to technical skills, I have honed numerous transferable skills, including communication, problem-solving, creativity, and leadership.

I did this while working full-time at a hospitality job and a second job at a Fish and Chip shop, which I stopped in the final year to give me extra time to work on my dissertation.

2. I aspire to a career in management consulting because it combines my passion for problem-solving with a dynamic environment. I'm driven to help organizations thrive by providing strategic insights, utilizing data analytics, and fostering innovation. Consulting offers the opportunity to make a meaningful impact and continuously learn in various industries.

3.  I also Strive to continuously learn new skills and hobbies, as i have recently taken up golf.  I may still be a danger to others around me sometimes with where the golf ball decides to go, but that is an improvement from hitting a tennis ball at a cyclist...

4. others have generally considered me to be good with people.  I've had to talk down intoxicated customers in previous work experience from fighting other customers.  And trust me when I say one of the most challenging things to do is explain to people who are drunk or addicted to alcohol why they cannot have anymore.  It mostly goes to plan, but you get a glass or punch thrown at you occasionally.  This has made me thick-skinned and good at conflict resolution.

5.  •	I have learnt to use databases and new software throughout my academic and working life. My educational background shows that I can efficiently navigate large information databases, contributing to my successful degree. I had to learn these intricacies independently since my first year and a half of university was during Covid away from the campus. I have learnt how to use cutting-edge software From financial and stock management using systems like AZTEC, Wisdom or a Time and Attendance system, demonstrating my ability to learn new software quickly and efficiently.

6. •	I have been a Shift Leader/Duty Manager and often the sole manager on shift. I have had to maintain the daily running of the work environment.  I collaborated with my team to ensure the smooth operation of the business.  I’ve learned that effective leadership isn’t just about direction, active listening, and empathy.   I've honed my decision-making abilities by assessing risks and making informed choices.  However, I am still young and continuous mentorship and learning will ensure that I can continue to refine my leadership style.",,Retail,"Hatfield, England, United Kingdom","Aylesbury, England, United Kingdom",1 year 5 months in role,1 year 5 months in company,,,,,,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEPHbX-bAkQ3w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1694804313801?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=FfnLMvmBBWAVfoDTfz92aI2CwfOFPm8-ACS8TAl6_vc,0,Liam O'Brien,ACwAAEZrr9oBuTUQyf8zL1tl2gjqRS-84MqcgWM,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAEZrr9oBuTUQyf8zL1tl2gjqRS-84MqcgWM/,false,false,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(recentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4046579090%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2CspellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aurn%253Ali%253Aorganization%253A21668932%2Ctext%3AOcado%2520Retail%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED%2Cparent%3A(id%3A0)))))%2Ckeywords%3Aconversion%2520OR%2520cro%2520OR%2520optimization%2520OR%2520%2522A%252FB%2520testing%2522%2520OR%2520growth%2520OR%2520Ecomm%2520OR%2520Web)&sessionId=4xwjN013QvqVsnGjQPA%2FOA%3D%3D,2025-01-08T10:08:27.856Z,https://linkedin.com/in/liam-o-brien-87680428b

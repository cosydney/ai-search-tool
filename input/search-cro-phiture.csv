As product leader, I have grown AirHelp (YC) B2B2C lead generation products, in partnerships with the biggest OTAs in the world (Skyscanner, Trip.com), to €15M+.

As venture builder, I launched a new B2B SaaS product vertical at Visual Meta company builder (Axel Springer), providing our customers a new channel to generate leads at 3x conversion rates. 

I cover the full spectrum from hypothesis-driven validation, to building and post-launch growth.

• Marketing tools: scaled AirHelp revenues from B2B lead gen partnerships to €15M+ (via Skyscanner, Expedia) 
• B2B: launched a new B2B version of AirHelp (via Trip.com), selling 10k units in the first month
• Consumer apps: brought 3 new products to the market at AirHelp (YC), testing plans, funnels and USPs
• Ecommerce: conceptualised, tested and launched a new product at Visual Meta in less than 3 months
• Travel: launched the Plus version of AirHelp, driving revenues to €2M+ in the middle of the pandemic

What I do:
1. Product discovery & validation (interviews, low-cost tests, MVPs)
2. Product launch (testing, building, go-to-market) 
3. Product growth & experimentation (conversion rate optimisation, analysis, AB tests)

I like to dive into the weird and wonderful connections between humans and nature, and how identity can be... well, fluid! After snagging a Graphic Design degree back in 2010 and spending a few years as an Art Director and Illustrator, I made the bold move in 2014 to focus on fine art.

I’ve had the chance to show my work at various exhibitions and art fairs (fancy, right?) and even had my first solo show, “Biophilia,” in 2016. I also spent 5 months in Hungary as part of The Budapest Art Factory Residency, where I explored new mediums. Fast forward a few years and I was living in Berlin around 2020. Cue Covid (uh oh). 

So, with time to think, I decided to teach myself how to sculpt—because why not? Now, my sculptures reflect my personal experiences, with migraines (ugh).

In all companies that I've worked for, I've always been surrounded by innovation and a willingness to make things differently. 

At Via Verejo, Brazilian e-commerce, we implemented and grew the Advertising Business Unit for marketplaces and industry players, such as P&G and Samsung for example. It was the first e-commerce in brazil to focus and believed in this new revenue source. A couple of years after, I joined the marketing and acquisition team of the first Brazilian Digital Insurance company, Youse, which breaks the car insurance market developing a completely different way of buying.   

Nowadays, even in a traditional company such as Gm Financial, I'm in a project management area that is responsible for developing and releasing the company's significant digital innovation.

I am passionate about exploring different subjects, places and cultures. Therefore, I'm an enthusiastic about working with multidisciplinary and multicultural teams.

Working as a virtual assistant has given me the professional skills to be able to manage administrative tasks remotely and sharpen my skills to be more knowledgeable about how business is managed, well-arranged, and scheduled.  

Then, I worked as a customer support agent and my vision toward business took another angle. I was able to see the business from another perspective, not only from the management area/concept only but from the customer's behavior and received feedback. 

Without being a civil engineer, I was not able to design, assess, evaluate and manage all that.

Simultaneously, I was evolving significantly as an animator. It started from a position of a digital composer in postproduction of ""The Peter and The Wolf"" animation (Oscar winner 2006). After this experience I started implementing my animation expertise into a graphic design. As a result of this experiment I discovered my other passion – a motion design.

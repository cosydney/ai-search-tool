# CSV People Filter MCP Server

An MCP server that enables filtering people from CSV files based on search descriptions using AI-powered matching.

## Overview

This MCP server follows the [Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp) and enables users to:

1. Upload CSV files containing people data
2. Filter people from the CSV files based on search descriptions
3. Get filtered results as a new CSV file

The server uses AI to analyze job titles and descriptions to find relevant matches based on your search criteria.

## CSV Format Requirements

- `title`: The person's job title

Additional columns are preserved in the output.

## Example Usage with Claude

Here's an example of how to use this MCP server with Claude:

1. Upload a CSV file:
   ```
   Please upload a CSV file with people data so I can help you filter through it.
   ```

2. Filter people based on a description:
   ```
   Find me all marketing directors with experience in digital transformation.
   ```

3. Get more specific with filtering:
   ```
   From the previous results, find people who have been in their role for less than 2 years.
   ```

## How It Works

The server uses a two-step filtering process:
1. **Title Filtering**: Uses AI to extract relevant title keywords from your search description and finds people with matching job titles.
2. **AI Verification** (optional): Further refines results by having AI verify if each person is a good match for your search.
